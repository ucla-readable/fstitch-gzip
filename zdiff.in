# Zcmp and zdiff are used to invoke the cmp or the  diff  pro-
# gram  on compressed files.  All options specified are passed
# directly to cmp or diff.  If only 1 file is specified,  then
# the  files  compared  are file1 and an uncompressed file1.gz.
# If two files are specified, then they are  uncompressed  (if
# necessary) and fed to cmp or diff.  The exit status from cmp
# or diff is preserved.

usage="Usage: z$prog [OPTION]... FILE1 [FILE2]
Compare FILE1 to FILE2, using their uncompressed contents if they are
compressed.  If FILE2 is omitted, compare FILE1 to the uncompressed
contents of FILE1.gz.  Do comparisons like '$prog' does.

OPTIONs are the same as for '$prog'.
